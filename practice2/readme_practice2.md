Step 1: Pre-processing raw reads
Step 2: Mapping on a reference genome
Step 3: Calculating the abundance of reads aligned to each genomic element (i.e. exon, gene or isoform)
Step 4: Biological Interpretation of gene expression profiles
To practice, you can prepare all of the pipelines listed in this video on server.t-bio.info using the demo option. 
Learn more about running demo pipelines as explained in this video.
